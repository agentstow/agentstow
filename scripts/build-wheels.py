"""Assemble the PyPI wheels from built binaries.

    scripts/build-wheels.py <out-dir> [target ...]

Each target is the same "<platform>-<arch>" name build-npm.sh uses, and the
binary for a target is read from target/<rust-triple>/release/agentstow, so a
release packs the *identical* binary that the tarball and the npm package ship.
Nothing is compiled here.

There is no pyproject.toml and no maturin on purpose: maturin would recompile
the crate in a second six-target matrix rather than reuse the artifacts the
build job already produced. A wheel is a zip with a prescribed layout, so it is
cheaper to write that layout than to build everything twice.

The binary goes in <name>-<version>.data/scripts/, which pip installs into the
environment's bin/ (Scripts/ on Windows) and marks executable — that is what
makes `pip install agentstow` and `uvx agentstow` put a working `agentstow` on
PATH without any Python entry-point shim in between.
