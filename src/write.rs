//! Atomic file replacement for the Rendered families.
//!
//! Rendered files hold resolved secrets and live in directories another program
//! is actively writing, so a half-written file is not an acceptable failure
//! mode. Every write goes to a private temp file beside the target and arrives
//! by `rename`, which is atomic on a POSIX filesystem.
//!
//! A symlinked target is resolved first — including a *dangling* one, whose
//! target does not exist yet. A dotfiles manager may own the real file
//! elsewhere, and replacing its link with a regular file would quietly break
//! that wiring precisely when the user could least afford it.
