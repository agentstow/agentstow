//! The hooks family — command-hooks, declared once, merged into each agent's
//! native hook arrays.
//!
//! Ownership here is **element identity** (ADR-0003): a hook object whose
//! command string matches a Commons hook is agentstow's to update, and every
//! other element in the same event array belongs to whoever put it there. That
//! matters more than usual, because these arrays are where several tools
//! (claude-mem, plugins, the user) all keep their own hooks.
//!
//! Two deliberate limits:
//!
//! * **Trust metadata is never written.** Codex records a `trusted_hash` per
//!   hook in `config.toml`, a different file from the `hooks.json` this writes,
//!   so approving code execution stays the user's decision by construction.
//! * **Scripts are not managed.** A Commons command must be a path that means the
//!   same thing to every agent; agentstow syncs the declaration, not the file
//!   it runs.
//! * **`${env:VAR}` is not expanded.** The command string *is* the identity, so
//!   it must not vary with the ambient environment — a resolved command would
//!   stop matching the reference that produced it, leaving the hook reported as
//!   missing and its own rendering as foreign, on every run, forever. A hook
//!   that needs a secret should read it from the environment itself; then the
//!   value never reaches the config file at all.
