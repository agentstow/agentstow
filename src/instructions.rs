//! The instructions family: one `AGENTS.md` in the Commons, reaching every agent
//! by whichever mechanism that agent supports.
//!
//! Three mechanisms, because agents differ in kind and not just in path:
//! a plain symlink where the whole file can be ours; an **import-line** where
//! the file is the user's and we may only add one additive, idempotent line;
//! and a **rules-dir link** where the agent globs a directory.
//!
//! A Foreign file already occupying the destination is a conflict: agentstow
//! reports it with a remediation hint and writes nothing. Resolving it is a
//! decision about someone else's content, which is not agentstow's to make.
