//! The glossary, made executable — as far as that is honest.
//!
//! CONTEXT.md defines the project's language and lists retired words under
//! _Avoid_. This test scans every string literal in `src/**/*.rs` — the pool
//! every user-facing message is drawn from — and fails on the avoid-terms that
//! can be checked mechanically without drowning in false positives:
//!
//! * **`store`** (word-bounded, any case) — the pre-v2 name for the Commons.
//!   Ordinary English containing the letters — "restored", "restoring",
//!   "stored" — is not word-bounded and never matches.
//! * **`subagents`** (word-bounded) — the agents family's pre-v2 name. One
//!   occurrence is allowlisted: `Family::PRE_V2_AGENTS_NAME` in
//!   `src/family.rs`, the single literal behind both the config-key alias and
//!   doctor's leftover-directory hint. The count is pinned at exactly one, so
//!   both a new literal and a stale allowlist fail.
//! * The avoid-**phrases** with no legitimate other sense: "canonical source",
//!   "central repo", "agentstow's directory", "zero-config agent",
//!   "linked skill", "repo-backed".
//!
//! What this test deliberately does NOT enforce, and why: several avoid-words
//! are homonyms with load-bearing legitimate uses, so a blanket scan would
//! flag correct sentences and train people to allowlist. "source" is the worst
//! offender — banned for the central directory, yet **Source** is itself a
//! defined term (the outside home of a Sourced entry) that messages must say.
//! "linked" is the fan-out mechanism's own vocabulary ("1 linked", "will be
//! linked"), so only the phrase "linked skill" is banned. "external",
//! "override" and "conflict" have the same problem — **Conflict** is a defined
//! term with its own glossary entry — as do ordinary verbs like "import"
//! ("import line" is a mechanism), "add", "reset" and "delete". Those words
//! rely on review against CONTEXT.md, not on this test; partial enforcement
//! here must not be mistaken for full.
//!
//! The enforced terms are read back out of CONTEXT.md at runtime: if the
//! glossary ever drops one, this test fails so the rules are re-derived
//! rather than silently enforcing a stale glossary.
//!
//! Scope and mechanics: string literals only — comments, identifiers and doc
//! text are not user-facing output. Extraction is a pragmatic hand-rolled
//! scanner (comments skipped, char literals and raw strings handled, escape
//! sequences read as word boundaries); a `#[cfg(test)]` marker in a source
//! file ends its scan, on the idiomatic assumption that test modules sit at
//! the end of a file. Sources outside `src/` — Cargo.toml's description, the
//! npm launcher's — are also user-facing but are not Rust and are not scanned.
